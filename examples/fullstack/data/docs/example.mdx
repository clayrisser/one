Changing themes in Tamagui is as easy as passing their name to the Theme component.

### Usage

Change themes anywhere in your app like so:

```tsx
import { Button, Theme } from 'tamagui' // or '@tamagui/core'

export default () => (
  <Theme name="dark">
    <Button>I'm a dark button</Button>
  </Theme>
)
```
